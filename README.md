The assignment uses Python 3.8.5. There are no specific dependencies to this application.
To run the program, simply call 'python main.py' to run with default datasets, or 'python main.py %training% %testing%'
to run with specified datasets, where %training% is the path to the training dataset, and %testing% is the path to the testing dataset.
If none are passed, the program uses "data/covid_training.tsv" for training, and "data/covid_test_public.tsv" for testing.
